# Budget App

## Description
This is a basic Python CLI application that employs the math, re, and unittest modules to track the user's budget. The code was initially created on replit, but transferred over to Github for easier access and workflow for potential future development/collaboration.

## Usage
In `main.py`, add your initial budget using the `Category` class created in budget.py! <br>
<br>
`NOTE: This Category class denotes the categories (such as clothing, food, rent, etc.) that your budget will be spent on` <br>
<br>
As you continue to withdraw funds, transfer them, or want to check your balance, or create a spending chart, add and print the methods accordingly in `main.py`. Then, run the following command in the terminal to view your resulting budget: `python3 main.py`. <br>
<br>
If you would like to run the unit tests, please run `python3 test_module.py` in the terminal.
