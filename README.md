# Budget App

## Description
This is a basic CLI application that employs Python and various modules to run a budget tracking application. The code was initially created on replit, but transferred over to Github for easier access and workflow for potential future development/collaboration.

## Usage
Add your budget deposits, withdrawal, or transfers to the main.py using the methods created in budget.py! Then, run the following command in the terminal to view your resulting budget:
`python3 main.py`
